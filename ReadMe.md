### Task 2: Minimum Viable Product

Once your repository is set up, practice what you learned today to create a portfolio site from the wireframe of your choosing. **You may choose any of the three wireframes in the "Wireframe Options" folder above.** Your complete project should look similar to the wireframe you chose, and include all of the following elements:

- [ ] A navigation bar with `About`, `Projects`, and `Contact` that link to the corresponding pages
- [ ] Gallery of projects created with flexbox - you may use random images in place of project screenshots for now with the random image link: https://picsum.photos/ or you may use images that mean something to you
- [ ] Information about you in place of the given placeholder
- [ ] A `My Projects` button that links to the projects page
- [ ] A `Contact Me` button that links to the contact page
- [ ] Links to any social media profiles (Instagram, linkedIn, Twitter) into the footer section of your home page

### Task 3: Stretch Goals

The following goals are designed to stretch your knowledge and may require additional research beyond what was learned in class today.

- [ ] Make your webpage work at different browser widths, including mobile
- [ ] Add CSS animations
- [ ] Design and execute your own wireframe for `About`, `Projects`, and `Contact` pages
- [ ] Host your website on Netlify.com

## FAQs

**What is a wireframe? How do I use one?**

_Wireframes are used to outline webpage styles, content, and functionality. UX designers will often use wireframes to explain their ideas to web developers. These wireframes, hand drawn or mocked up on software, are a cheap and easy way to iterate over designs. In this assignment you will chose a wireframe like the one below and create the elements with HTML and CSS._
